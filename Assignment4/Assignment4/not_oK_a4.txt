Query1: Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Query2: Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Query3: Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Query4: Your solution to subtask 4.4 is NOT equal to the wanted solution 4.4 .
 For example, for move4(s(1,4,3),_4120) 
 move4(s(1,4,3),s(8,-3,3)) 
 is shown in your program's output, but not by the wanted solution  
Query5: Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Query6: Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Query10: Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Query20: Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Your solution to subtask 4.40 is NOT equal to the wanted solution 4.40 .
 For example, for lidm40(_4118) 
 lidm40([s(8,0,0),s(3,5,0),s(3,2,3),s(6,2,0),s(6,0,2),s(1,5,2),s(1,4,3),s(4,4,0)]) 
 is shown by the wanted solution, but not in your program's output  
Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.
