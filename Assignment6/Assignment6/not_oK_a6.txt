Query1: Your solution to subtask 6.1 is NOT equal to the wanted solution 6.1 .
 For example, for isolate_final(a-b=<c-(d+e):->d,_11022) 
 isolate_final(a-b=<c-(d+e):->d,d=<c-(a-b)-e:->d) 
 is shown by the wanted solution, but not in your program's output  
Query2: Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.  
Query3: Your solution is most likely equivalent to the wanted solution.
